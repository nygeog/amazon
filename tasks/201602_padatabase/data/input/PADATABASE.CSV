She reminds PR professionals that the publication is mainly geared toward science-interested lay people, which includes business and policy leaders, educators, students, and science enthusiasts in every walk of life. While Scientific American covers medical and biotech topics, they generally do so from the standpoint of scientific advances, not consumer service. She recommends contacting the appropriate editors with press materials and pitching. Contact her via e-mail.
DiChristina was named the permanent editor in chief in December 2009 and had been serving as the interim editor in chief in June 2009. She joined the staff in 2001 as the executive editor.

My name is Leah Rubenstein and I'm a bookseller in Pittsburgh, PA. In addition to work, I have a review blog, The Pretty Good Gatsby. Currently I have just under 300 subscribers. I've had reviews featured on Katherine Howe's website, Curiosity Quills, Lee & Low, and Ruth Ozeki's website to name a few. Any reviews I post are cross-posted to GoodReads and Twitter.

I cover a wide range of genres from both adult and YA/MG authors and a link to my review archive can be found here. Recent reviews include The Thinking Woman's Guide to Real Magic by Emily Croy Barker (Adult, Fantasy), The Girl You Left Behind by Jojo Moyes (Adult, Fiction), and The Bone Season by Samantha Shannon (Adult, Fantasy). All three were ARCs and I was a participant on the blog tour for The Bone Season. Upcoming reviews include Dead Girls Don't Lie by Jennifer Shaw Wolf (YA, Thriller), The Lavender Garden by Lucinda Riley (Adult, Fiction), and Mr. Lynch's Holiday by Catherine O'Flynn (Adult Fiction).

You're getting this email because we've worked together at Bustle, and I've enjoyed it very much. (I'm sure I've left off a million wonderful people-no offense to anyone!) October 28 will be my last day at Bustle Books. I'll be moving out of literary editorial (unfortunately!), but I will continue to write freelance, mostly focusing on books and culture. (But I do really like sports, too.)


In in our dedicated Books vertical, we'll be covering primarily literary fiction, but are interested in memoir/non-fiction if the voice is compelling and striking. If you want to give your colleagues a heads up, I'm also interested in receiving non-fiction about gender, sexuality, relationships, and even fashion for our lifestyle sections.","10/28/15","ATW","ONLINE","NYC","NYC","ADULT, CELEB, ENT, LITFI, WOMFI",1148

As you may have heard, I have left the New York Public Library system for parts unknown (read: Evanston, IL).  I am now the Collection Development Manager of the Evanston Public Library system.  Tis a delightful place but in need of a certain something.  Books!  So if you would be so kind as to update your shipping addresses re: me, I would be ever so grateful.

My new address is:

Betsy Bird
Collection Development Manager
Evanston Public Library
1703 Orrington Avenue
Evanston, IL 60201

My new work email address is ebird@cityofevanston.org

If you would like to continue alerting the folks at NYPL/BPL of your titles, please retain my address and change the name to Christopher Lassen.

Thanks so much and I look forward to seeing you again at any number of conferences.

Cheers!

Betsy

Hello,
As some of you may have heard already, Elizabeth Taylor is retiring. I will continue to handle all books-related coverage - whether it's for our daily newspaper or Printers Row Journal - and will also be your contact for any excerpts for our Printers Row Journal short fiction supplement. Please be sure to send all ARCs and press releases to my attention for consideration.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks and best regards,
Jennifer

I plan to review books for kids ages 0-12, with an emphasis on:
'	fiction picture books,
'	nonfiction picture books,
'	early readers, and
'	graphic novels.
I have a M.S. in library science from the University of Illinois (December 2014 graduate) and am an aspiring elementary school librarian.

Delightful Children's Books receives ~2,000 views per day, and the blog's audience has been growing steadily over the past five years, including the past two years while I was in graduate school and blogging less frequently. I have followers on Pinterest (3,076), Facebook (1,138) and Twitter (842).

As newspapers and magazines struggle to survive -- in part by shrinking their coverage of authors and books -- the online Washington Independent Review of Books is not merely surviving, but thriving! Big things are happening in 2013 for the Independent, which is dedicated to provoking and sustaining conversations about all types of books.

THE NUMBERS
Since its launch in February of 2011, The Independent has reached these heights:
Reviews: over 730
Features: over 300
Publishers/Imprints whose books were reviewed: more than 100
Reviewers: approx. 250
Website visits: 188,593
Unique visitors: 127,852
Page views: 330,829

Monthly site visits have more than tripled, to well over 10,000 most months.
Web traffic from at least 100 blogs and author websites.
Visitors hail from all 50 states and 173 foreign countries.
Greatest traffic from (in order): 1) D.C., 2) New York, 3) Maryland, 4) Virginia, 5) California.

Epstein was hired on as a commodities editor in February 1992. His current role as economics editor had not previously existed within the organization before they had created it for him in 1993. Prior to joining Barron's, he was the chief economist for the New York Stock Exchange, where he spent 13 years, and started out on Wall Street as a commodities analyst in the mid 1970s.

He is also a Blogger and covers Entertainment and Celebrities for Choire Sicha.

He says publicists need to tailor pitches more closely to the demands of an online editor. 'The luxury of newspapers is that you would be the TV editor, or the dance editor, and now (bloggers are) all those things. So the side-product is that we're not so intimately related with all those fields. I don't know the things I should be paying attention to for the next theater season, I need someone to help me with that. We all kind of need a little more detailed attention.'

In regards to the types of pitches he wants to receive, he says, 'I'm definitely interested in culture. I'm definitely interested in people who make culture. And honestly, one of the things we are is a place where people can pitch things that everyone else would roll their eyes at. We don't care that it's not going look good on the cover of a weekend section.'

Contact him via e-mail.
Sicha co-founded The Awl in April 2009. He was previously an editor at large at Radar where he joined the staff in August 2007. He also served as a columnist for the New York Observer from April 2007 to June 2008. Prior to that, he had two seperate stints at Gawker Media, most recently as the managing editor of their flagship blog and first as the company's editorial director. Between these periods at Gawker, he was a senior writer for The New York Observer, which he left in January 2007.","11/08/13","ATW","ONLINE","NYC","NYC","ENT",1123

I'm writing to let you know that November 12th will be my last day at the Texas Book Festival. I'm excited to announce that I'll be joining my husband in Kyrgyzstan for his anthropological field work. The Festival has been an amazing experience for me, in large part because of y'all.* It's been a joy to work with you and put together one of the largest, longest running Festivals in the country together.

Later this week, I'll send out an email about your future contacts at the Texas Book Festival and information for next year.

I will continue to review books for Marie Claire and elsewhere so please note that the mailing address below will no longer be good for review copies and that I will be requesting e-galleys and pdfs in lieu of physical books. To discuss further, and/or if you'd like to stay in touch, you can reach me at opitzsteph@gmail.com.

I'll be in New York for the National Book Awards in a few weeks, and at AWP Los Angeles 2016, so will look forward to seeing many of you soon!

Warmly,
Steph

We prefer finished books over galleys.  Our current outlets for book reviews include:

* Spirituality & Practice website (www.SpiritualityandPractice.com).
The site has more than 170,000 visitors per month who read 5 million pages annually. New book reviews are published weekly to the Books section of the site, where visitors can also search a database of more than 5,000 book reviews.

Major categories reviewed include: spirituality, religion, self-help, fiction, public affairs, cultural criticism, nature/environment, health, and children's books.

We also do special features on gift and art books. Book reviews and features are referenced extensively in other areas of the website, including pages devoted to 37 essential spiritual practices, and our popular e-courses and online retreats.

Spirituality & Practice, which consistently ranks in the Top 10 for 'spirituality' on Google, is very active in social media. The website has 24,000 fans on Facebook. Summaries of new book reviews go into Frederic Brussat's Twitter feed to 34,000 followers.

Reviewer Frederic Brussat is the co-author of Spiritual Literacy: Reading the Sacred in Everyday Life, a national bestseller which ranks #7 on the list of Oprah's bestsellers at Amazon.

* 50 Best Spiritual Books of the Year Awards, presented annually (some of which are announced in July, with the balance in early January).

* Values & Visions Reviews Service, which provides book reviews to magazines such as The Lutheran (circ: 400,000). The reviews are often reprinted in community and religious newspapers and in church newsletters.

I've begun to compile some of them (I'm still not done putting the most recent ones up) at BookLust.org.   And I just wrote my first of what I hope to be many, many reviews for The New York Journal of Books.com.

It was a review of 'The Free,' the latest novel from Willy Vlautin and I highly recommend it.
http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/book-review/free-novel-ps

I'm writing to ask if you would be so very kind as to send me a review copy of ALL THE RAGE by the great A.L. Kennedy.  I love her novels, as well as her short fiction, and I can't wait to read this latest collection of stories. In fact, I was just reading the first one, 'Late In Life' on Amazon.com and I really dug it.  I really can't wait to read the rest and I want to review it in the Cincinnati CityBeat.  In fact, I do a number of author interviews for them and I wonder if she might be available at some point for a real quick phone interview.  If not, no big deal, but I would love to interview her after being such a fan of her prose for so long.

Dear book friends,

As many of you know, I'm a new editor at Brit.co, a women's media company that reaches over five million creative ladies a month. My goal is to expand their book coverage and help out some writers along the way, and I'd love your help!

If you know of any nonfiction authors or publicists with authors who would be interested in being featured/interviewed as experts on the following topics: beauty, fashion, cooking/health, party planning, DIYing, parenting, self-help/career advancement, general women's lifestyle, or technology, please send their info my way: angela@brit.co.

While I can't promise they'll be featured, I will try my best. (Fiction authors, don't worry, I'm working on getting you featured next! :) )

A few examples of experts and books we've spotlighted:

http://www.brit.co/parenting-books/
http://www.brit.co/manicure-tips/
http://www.brit.co/dinner-party-tips/
http://www.brit.co/mindy-kaling-new-book/

Please feel free to forward this to any friends who might be interested/know people who are interested. Thanks so much, and if you are ever in San Francisco, please let me know --- I'd love to catch up!

Best,
Angela

7/30/15: The reviews that don't get picked up by HelloGiggles I post on bookishnature.tumblr.com and then post the link on Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr to a network of over 6,000 followers. Generally, my interest lies in thrillers, comedy, and horror. I recently read one of the books that was available to download to the kindle and have reviewed on Goodreads.

Subject: The Life Sentence

Hi:

I'm writing to let you know I'm leaving my post as the mystery editor of the LARB to launch a new crime fiction site called The Life Sentence. We will be in beta in March and live in April.
Please pitch me now at this email, not at the LARB (or it's fine to pitch at my personal yahoo address), and feel free to pass this along to your colleagues. Thanks!
Amazon has a crime fiction arm too, doesn't it? Could one of you put me in touch with them or forward this and cc me? I'd love for them to know about the site.
Thanks,
Lisa Levy

Atticus Review is a weekly online journal that publishes stories, poems, flash prose, creative nonfiction, mixed media, book reviews, and other genre-busting words of wisdom and interactive literary whimsy.

Atticus Review is open to critical reviews of poetry, short fiction, creative nonfiction, novels, graphic novels, serials, etc. However, please avoid sending reviews of genre work (romance, sci-fi, etc.), technical books, and large publishing house books that will get plenty of promotion and notice otherwise.

We will consider two types of reviews: single-author reviews of 1,000-1,500 words and omnibus reviews of up to 3,500 words. In the interest of fairness and relative objectiveness, we ask that you disclose any relationship you have/had with the author. We want reviews that place work within a larger literary or cultural context, but also give close attention to craft. “Tough” reviews are welcome, but should be fair and not mere pan jobs.

The editor occasionally receives books for review. If you are open to reviewing one of these books, please feel free to contact Sam Slaughter at slaughter.sj@gmail.com. If you are an author or publisher who wishes to submit a book for review consideration, please send a copy to: Sam Slaughter, P.O. Box 1064, 336 E.

Gunn can be contacted via phone,

Gunn is a former NASA scientist and engineer. She speaks regularly on the impact of cyberspace on society, the economic opportunities of the Internet, and her experience as a woman in science and technology.

I'm also working to revive the '5 Questions With…' where we ask authors five questions (via email) and post them online Fridays. This is a great way to spotlight authors who have new books coming out or a particularly exciting project on which they are working. I will also, from time to time, reach out to specific authors when I think they would be particularly fitting (Kazu Kibuishi for We Love Graphic Novels Week, Dav Pilkey for Banned Books Week).

Regarding PR, she says that too many people call to confirm receipt of information. 'These calls are very time consuming and it's a virtual guarantee that if they sent it, it was received,' she says. She also gets too many news releases 'with incomplete information: no time, no ticket prices, etc.' Contact her via e-mail.

Hope you're well! I'm writing to let you know about some changes at NPR's All Things Considered and Weekend All Things Considered. Please pass along to other members of your team who may not have received this email.

By October 1st, both shows will have new hosts.

At All Things Considered, NPR correspondents Ari Shapiro and Kelly McEvers are joining the shows as hosts. They join current hosts Robert Siegel and Audie Cornish. (Melissa Block has left the show.) Ari and Kelly's first show is on September 21st.

At Weekend All Things Considered, Arun Rath is leaving the show at the end of September. The show is moving back to Washington DC, where the new host will be Michel Martin, formerly of Tell Me More. Her first show will be October 3/4.

I am staying in Los Angeles to produce for (weekday) All Things Considered, starting in September. I will be continuing to organize books coverage at ATC, so please keep sending me books and pitches for the four weekday ATC hosts. Also, feel free to write to me about ATC dibs held by other people if you're not getting a response from them.

My address and phone number are staying the same:

Becky Sullivan
NPR/All Things Considered
9909 Jefferson Blvd
Culver City, CA 90232
310-815-4227

Kelly McEvers is also located at NPR West and can be reached at the same Culver City address. Ari Shapiro will be based in DC (1111 North Capitol St NE, Washington DC 20002).

The WATC production staff is in a bit of flux. The best temporary contact is Kenya Young, the new executive producer of the show. She is based in DC and can be reached at kyoung@npr.org. She will hopefully know soon who the new permanent books contact will be for WATC. Any questions about WATC in October and beyond are best directed to her for now.

Feel free to call or email if you have any questions, and thanks,

Becky

Broadcast days and times vary from station to station. Hosted by Mike Cuthbert, the show includes two 30-minute interviews with experts on a wide range of subjects of interest to Americans ages 40 and up. Guests include athletes, sportscasters, journalists, business leaders, politicians, authors, actors, and other national newsmakers. Guests discuss topics covering many points of view and interests. This show is distributed by approximately 190 stations and through SiriusXM, channel 141.

Prime Time Focus is one of the most popular daily news and features series in the country, heard on more than 500 stations. With its snappy mix of consumer, medical, and cultural topics, Prime Time Focus appeals to thousands of baby boomer and older listeners who tune in to the daily 90-second program and five-minute weekend broadcasts.

Prime Time Focus aims to educate, inform, and provide gems for thought. On one day host Jim Harriott talks with guests about Viagra and the new lifestyle drugs, and, on another day, the topic is gossip journalism or animal-to-human transplants. Listeners meet sports greats, authors, and movie stars from yesteryear, as well as policymakers talking about the most pressing issues of the day.","04/29/15","DC","RADIO","DC","DC, NATI","CELEB",2556

Avoid sending gimick mailings; hard sell pitches will get you nowhere.

Profiles of about 2,500 are also good to pitch and should be about a woman who is under-the-radar, but whose life experiences resonate with their audience.

She likes to hear about women of achievement and is also interested in lifestyle subject matter such as travel, health, relationships and personal finance. Books or authors are also pitchable.","04/29/15","DC","ONLINE","NATI","NATI, NYC","",2560

We have hosted world class speakers and authors including Sheryl Sandberg, Michael Chabon, Ayelet Waldman, Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, Eve Ensler, Amy Tan and Mitch Albom. This year will mark the third year on which the OFJCC has hosted Litquake, the largest literary festival on the West Coast.

Our Cultural Arts Hall can seat 400 people and is equipped with state of the art A/V equipment.

We can also include book sales at our events in partnership with a bookstore like Kepler's or include one with the price of the ticket.

In addition, we've presented musical artists including Colbie Calliat, Arturo Sandoval, Ron Carter and Branford Marsalis, just to name a few.

I'd love to get on your mailing list for authors touring the Bay Area. My contact information is below.

Thanks so much,

We also field the La Jolla Writers Conference. Now in its 15th year, it has been named by Writer's Digest as one of the 84 conferences in the country worth the money.  A pay-it-forward conference, everyone who participates as faculty and all who organize it donate their time. It is an income stream for no one.   We attract some stellar writers both on faculty (Michael Connelly, Tess Gerritsen, Lisa Gardner, Debbie Macomber, Linda Lael Miller, Jane Green, Dottie Frank, Dale Brown, Jim Rollins, Jim Grippando, Margaret Weis, Lisa Jackson, Steve Berry, John Lescroart, Andrew Peterson, and so many more have taught and keynoted for us.

Love to discuss some of your authors with you. And would love to have a couple of your editors teach.

This program tends not to run stories about books and authors, as it is more issue-based in content. She still loves to hear about new books coming out, as they may be interested in the topic and interview the author for a story in the future. When pitching a story idea, it is helpful to have an idea of what visual elements could be incorporated, since illustrations are important in television.

Jette Hanley says, 'We're looking for anything pertaining to religion and ethics. We're always interested in hearing about events, even cultural. Those are always of interest to us.' Having promotional video that is accessible to the media (in Beta or DVC Pro formats) can be helpful, as they produce stories on a limited budget. Please do not phone; email and fax are the most efficient ways to reach her.
Jette Hanley was named senior associate producer for Religion & Ethics Newsweekly in May 2007. Before that, she was an associate producer for the show since 1999. She joined Religion & Ethics in 2007 as a production assistant. Before that, she was a production assistant for WETA-TV since 1996.

Subject: Changes in Cleveland Plain Dealer book reviews

Hello,

At the behest of Books Editor Joanna Connors, I am writing to let you know that there are some changes being made in the Plain Dealer's book coverage in regards to mystery reviews.  We will continue to run monthly mystery reviews by myself and freelancer Michelle Ross -  and the column will even be given more space, allowing more reviews. However, we will no longer have a 'book room' at the paper to store advance copies. So I am asking that any mystery review copies be sent directly to my home address:

Laura DeMarco
8620 Pinehurst Dr.
Parma, Ohio 44129


Thank you for your assistance. Please email me or Joanna (Jconnors@plaind.com) if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
Laura DeMarco
Laura DeMarco
Arts & Entertainment Reporter
The Plain Dealer

I'm writing to 'introduce' Rebecca Cochran, who will be taking over from me as the reviews editor from Historical Novels Review working with AmazonCrossing. We'll be working together on our upcoming May issue, but then I'll be stepping down. I would appreciate it if you could add Rebecca to your mailing lists!

I would like to take this opportunity to request a few AmazonCrossing titles that I spotted on your website. Could copies be sent of Sarah Lark's Toward the Sea of Freedom and Petra Durst-Benning's While the World is Still Asleep? Both are authors that our readers like to hear about.  Catherine Shepherd's The Reaper of Zons also caught my eye as something I'd like to request for review consideration, though I missed the first book in the series when it came out earlier this year. Are there any other historical titles forthcoming from AmazonCrossing that I've overlooked?

We do have a galley in the office, but I don't want to take it out of the review process.

And if you can, or have the inclination, feel free to alert me (press releases, galleys) to any authors/titles you feel particularly excited about - I'm always interested in authors/books that will be good subjects for our newsletter and print platforms.
